                            <p>The ultimate target of an educational institution is to enhance the performance of every student. This can promptly be achieved by analyzing the performance of each student using competent analytic tools such as a dashboard. The information thus obtained can be deployed for taking effective as well as corrective measures to help them in performing better and realizing their potential. If not done systematically, this process may become time consuming and tedious. <em>Student Information System (SIS)</em> assists the institutions to manage every single detail about students in a holistic, organized and cost-effective way. Education ERP completely and efficiently eliminates the need of faculty members to spend a considerable amount of time in compiling student data. Thereby assisting the faculty members in channelizing their concentration on the students and their performance enhancement.</p>

                                        <h3>Maximum Organization With Minimal Paperwork:</h3>
                                        <p>The SIS software designed exclusively for academic institutions by MasterSoft helps the educational campuses in streamlining and managing all the tasks involved in student admission. It makes the time consuming and hectic <a href="../../blog/online-admission-system-for-educational-institutions.html"><strong>process of student enrollment easy by reducing the paperwork considerably</strong></a> and digitizing each process for achieving productivity and transparency.</p>

The faculty can effortlessly issue updated report cards, manage student's transcripts and obtain any information on the go. A student's progress can also be tracked with the help of various analytic tools and dashboards available, which also have various types of filters for varying uses. Also a student's health records can be maintained in order to be informed about any allergies or illnesses they might suffer from, to keep a check on their well-being.</p>

This ensures hassle-free and error free collection of fees without any burden on the staff as well as the students. Notification is sent after receiving the fee amount, making the transaction transparent and secure. Also, an email or SMS alert can be sent to students with overdues.

Also, a very limited number of hardware is required on campus as most of the hardware is maintained by the ERP provider, which makes it maintenance free and cost effective. Moreover, education institutes have the facility to pay as per their usage. Another benefit of cloud-based SIS is that institutes do not require appointing any hardware or software engineer staff.</p>

Timely notifications and emails are sent to the students informing them about every admission process taking place online. Customization of this data can be done by the administration enabling them to be transparent in their allotment process as well as securing confidential data. Students can also keep track of their application through SIMS.</p>
